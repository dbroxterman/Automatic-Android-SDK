----------------
A LOT OF BREAKING CHANGES!!!
1. Change almost all static methods to instance methods in the Automatic class.
2. No longer provide raw BT socket for ELM streaming. A send command/callback mechanism is used instead. 3rd party app developers no longer need to maintain a raw BT socket themselves.
(Ok this is not true. Raw BT socket for ELM streaming is still supported)
3. Decouple ELM streaming connection from login. ELM connection/authentication is now a separate step after Automatic account login.
Refer to the sample app and java doc for more details.
